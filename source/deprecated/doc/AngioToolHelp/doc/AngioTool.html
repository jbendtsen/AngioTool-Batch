<ol>

  <li>  Double click on the <strong>AngioTool</strong> icon in your desktop &nbsp   
    <img alt="ATIcon20 128x128 (6K)" src="../images/ATIcon20%20128x128.gif" height="32" width="32" />
  	&nbsp or on the executable file (AngioTool.exe) located in the folder where the program was installed.
  	The main GUI has two separate tabs: "<strong>Analysis</strong>" and "<strong>Settings</strong>" <p>&nbsp </p>
  	<center>	<img alt="GUI1 (60K)" src="../images/GUI1.PNG" height="400" width="273" /> &nbsp
  	<img alt="GUI2 (53K)" src="../images/GUI2.PNG" height="400" width="273" /></center>
  	<p></p>
	</li>
	
  <li>  Open an image by clicking the <strong>Open Image</strong> button &nbsp  
    <img alt="OpenImages642 (8K)" src="../images/OpenImages642.png" height="32" width="32" /> 
  	&nbsp in the Analysis tab (see instruction #9 for how to resize the image). AngioTool will open the image in a separate window and will perform an initial 
  	selection of vessels based on pre-set parameters. The vessel selection is shown by a yellow overlay on the 
  	image. In order to tune the selection of the vessels the analysis parameters can be adjusted. <p></p>
  	<center><img alt="ImageExample (871K)" src="../images/ImageExample.png" height="600" width="637" /></center>
  	<p></p>
	</li>
  	
  <li>  Adjust the <strong>Vessel diameter</strong> and <strong>Vessel intensity</strong> controls. <p></p>
    <center><img alt="VesselDiameterIntensity (5K)" src="../images/VesselDiameterIntensity.PNG" height="176" width="497" /></center><p></p>
  	Click on the <strong>Vessel diameter</strong> control to select vessels based on their diameter. Selections 
  	are shown as red ticks which can be individually toggled off by clicking on them. 
		Clicking on higher diameter values will select thicker vessels and vice versa.
		Multiple selections are allowed.
		The vessels outline will dynamically update its shape in response to the 
		adjustments done to the controls. 
		This enables rapid visual fine tuning of the selection. 
		By default, this control presents the user with a broad range of possible 
		thicknesses. However if necessary, the upper limit of this range can be 
		dynamically modified by adjusting the spinner next to the control.
  	<p></p>
		The second control, <strong>Vessel intensity</strong>, allows to select 
		vessels based on their intensity. In order to detect 
  	fainter vessels drag the lower thumb to lower numbers. To eliminate 
		nonspecific high intensity pixels from the selection lower the higher thumb. 
		<p></p>
	</li> 
  	
  <li>
  	Two additional controls are provided to fine tune the vessel selection. <p></p>
  	<center><img alt="ForeBackParticles (7K)" src="../images/ForeBackParticles.PNG" height="180" width="498" /></center>
  	<p></p>
  	To eliminate background particles by size adjust the <strong>Remove small particles</strong> 
		control. Particles smaller than the size selected in the control will be 
		removed from the selection.  
		To fill unselected areas inside vessels adjsut the <strong>Fill holes</strong> control. 
		To activate these controls click on their associated checkbox. The 
		associated spiners can be used to dynamically modify the range of the 
		controls. Remember to always consult the actual changes in the outline 
		overlay of the test image.  
  	<p></p> 
  </li>	
	
	<li>
		The <strong>Hide Overlay</strong> button toggles the overlay on and off 
		helping to evaluate the accuracy of the selection at every 
		moment during the analysis. 
		<p></p>
		<center><img alt="HideOverlay (11K)" src="../images/HideOverlay.PNG" height="246" width="288" /></center>
		<p></p>
	</li>
		
	<li>
	  Click on the Excel icon in the <strong>Saving Preferences</strong> panel to 
		select the file in which to save the data generated in the analysis. The path 
		of the selected file will be shown on the associated textbox. 
		If a directory and a name are not set, an Excel file will be generated and 
		saved with a unique name (ResultsXXXXXX.xls) in the folder where the test 
		image is located. 		
		Click on the <strong>Save result image</strong> checkbox to instruct the 
		program to save the image resulting from the analysis. By default, the 
		resulting this image will be saved to the same location where the test image 
		is located. 
	 <p></p>
	<center><img alt="SavingPreferences (13K)" src="../images/SavingPreferences.PNG" height="148" width="500" /></center>
	<p></p>
	</li>	
	
	<li>
	Once the outline overlay best matches the vessels in the test image, click the 
	<strong>Run analysis</strong> button &nbsp
	<img alt="RunAnalysis64-2 (7K)" src="../images/RunAnalysis64-2.png" height="32" width="32" /> &nbsp 
	to start the analysis (see instruction #10 to learn how to set the calibration). 
	The progress bar at the bottom of the main GUI will 
	update on the progress of the analysis. Once the analysis is completed the 
	resulting overlay will show the outline of the area covered by vessels, the 
	skeleton and the 
	branching points (points in the image where two or more skeleton segments
	meet).
	<p></p>
	<center><img alt="ResultImage (851K)" src="../images/ResultImage.png" height="600" width="639" /> </center>
	<p></p>
	</li>
	
	
  <li>
	Both the analysis settings and the computed parameters are written in 
	separated blocks to the indicated Excel file. The recorded analysis settings 
	include the date and time of the analysis, the location of the test image, and 
	the user selected values for the controls in the <strong>Analysis tab </strong>
	and the calibration information in the <strong>Setting tab</strong>.  
	Data generated in separate AngioTool sessions but written to the same Excel 
	file are appended at the end of the file each with bold headings (red arrows). 
	<p></p>
	<center><img alt="ExcelFile (138K)" src="../images/ExcelFile.png" height="192" width="640" /></center>
	<p></p>
	</li>	

	<li>
	The <strong>Settings</strong> tab provides with controls to customize the 
	analysis and the results. Use the <strong>Resize Image</strong> control to 
	downsize the test image. Resizing the test image will result in significantly 
	faster ananlysis often without impact on the results of the analysis. 
	To activate this control click the <strong>Resize Image</strong> checkbox and 
	use the associated spinner to enter the desired resizing factor. This control 
	needs to be set prior to opening the test image and will lock after the image 
	is openes. Click on the unlock/lock icon &nbsp
	<img alt="locked (3K)" src="../images/locked.png" height="36" width="29" /> &nbsp / &nbsp
	<img alt="unlocked (3K)" src="../images/unlocked.png" height="36" width="38" /> &nbsp 
	to lock/unlock the control.<p></p>
	<center><img alt="ResizeImage (4K)" src="../images/ResizeImage.PNG" height="116" width="497" /></center>
	<p></p>
	</li>
	
	<li>
	Use the <strong>Calibration</strong> control to define a correlation between 
	pixels and an alternative unit length in the image (AngioTool uses millimeters 
	as unit of length). To set a calibration type the length in pixels in the 
	<strong>Distance in pixels</strong> box and the corresponding length in 
	millimeters in the <strong>Distance in mm</strong> box. 
	This control needs to be set before running the analysis of the image.  <p></p>
	<center><img alt="Calibration (3K)" src="../images/Calibration.PNG" height="116" width="496" /></center>
	<p></p>
	</li>
	
	<li>
	Use the <strong>Overlay Settings</strong> to customize the appearance 
	(stroke width and colour) of the different components of the overlay. 
	Click on the checkboxes to show or 	hide the different components of the 
	overlay and the associated spinners and color boxes to customize their 
	width and color. Use the <strong>Save Image</strong> button to save the 
	resulting image after adjusting the Overlay Settings. The format of the 
	image can be set in the associated listbox.  
	<p></p>
	<center><img alt="OverlaySettings (10K)" src="../images/OverlaySettings.PNG" height="258" width="503" /></center>
	<p></p>
	</li>
	
  <li>
	The <strong>Help</strong> button 
	&nbsp 
	<img alt="help64 (8K)" src="../images/help64.png" height="32" width="32" />
	&nbsp shows this guide. 
	<p></p>
	</li>
	
	<li>
	Use the <strong>Exit</strong> button 
	&nbsp 
	<img alt="Close64 (4K)" src="../images/Close64.png" height="32" width="32" />
