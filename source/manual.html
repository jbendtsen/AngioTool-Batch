  <h2>About</h2>
  <p>AngioTool was originally written by the Center for Cancer Research in 2011. It could only process one image at a time, which made it unsuitable for certain tasks, despite the image processing features it possessed.</p>
  <p>This version of AngioTool started by simply adding batch processing as a separate feature, where the user could select multiple folders instead of just one image at a time. However, after processing the 15th or so image, it would run out of memory and cease to function.</p>
  <p>As such, the goal of the project was expanded, and gradually the entire program was rewritten piece by piece, including a new user interface, to allow for the batch processing feature to work as intended.</p>

  <h2>Features</h2>
  <h3>Batch Processing</h3>
  <p>
This feature allows the user to analyse multiple folders containing any amount of images.
These folders are recursed fully, meaning that any image that belongs to any folder within or below any selected folder will be included in the batch.
The same settings will be applied to every image, and the statistics of every scan will be saved to the provided Excel spreadsheet.
  </p><p>
To use this feature:
<ol>
    <li>Click the Batch button at the top of the main window.</li>
    <li>In the new window, click the "Select input folders" button. At least one folder containing images should be selected.</li>
    <li>Click the "Excel spreadsheet" button. You may select an existing spreadsheet file, into which a new sheet will be added, or a new file.</li>
    <li>Select the output image mode, out of:</li>
    <ul>
        <li>No output: no result images will be created</li>
        <li>Same folders as inputs: each result image will be saved next to its corresponding input image</li>
        <li>Save result images to: select an existing or new folder under which all result images will be saved</li>
    </ul>
    <li>If "Save result images to" is selected, then click the adjacent folder button to select or create the folder.</li>
    <li>If desired, you may change the result image format from TIFF by typing into the "Result image format" text box. You may enter any format from the following: TIFF, TIF, PNG, JPG, JPEG, GIF, BMP, PPM</li>
    <li>If desired, you may override the default job count. This refers to the number of concurrent jobs that may run at the same time. To achieve the highest throughput, the job count should match the number of cores on your computer's CPU. The program will display what this number is. The default job count is set to 3/4 of this number, which allows for other programs your device to run as normal.</li>
    <ul>
        <li>To override the job count, check the box next to "Override job count" and enter a new number into the text box.</li>
    </ul>
    <li>Click "Run" to start the batch. While it runs, it's possible to analyse another image in the Analysis window or start another batch.</li>
</ol>
  <h3>Image Analysis</h3>
  <p>Analyze a single image in a new window. Supports panning and zooming, and changing the settings to update the preview in real time.</p>

  <h2>Settings</h2>
  <p>AngioTool 2.0 provides various customizable settings to tailor image analysis:</p>

  <h3>Lacunarity</h3>
  <p>Measure how much space is empty.</p>
  
  <h3>Thickness</h3>
  <p>Measure the average vessel thickness.</p>

  <h3>Fill Holes</h3>
  <p>Fill in gaps between vessels below a certain size.</p>
  
  <h3>Remove Particles</h3>
  <p>Remove particles below a certain size.</p>
  
  <h3>Max Hole Level</h3>
  <p>The brightest a hole can be before it shall be filled in.</p>
  
  <h3>Min Boxness</h3>
  <p>The lowest "boxness" value that a hole can have before it shall be filled in.</p>
  <p>Boxness is defined as: min(holeWidth / holeHeight, holeHeight / holeWidth) * pixelCount / (holeWidth * holeHeight)</p>
  <p>The more a hole resembles square, the closer the boxness value will be to 100% and the further it will be from 0%.</p>
  
  <h3>Min Length &#xF7 Area</h3>
  <p>The lowest area divided by length that a hole can have before it shall be filled in.</p>
  
  <h3>Skeletonizer</h3>
  <p>Finds the center line of each vessel.</p>

  <h3>Max Skeleton Steps</h3>
  <p>Cap the number of times an image can be iterated upon by the skeletonizer.</p>
  <p>Each skeletonization iteration thins the edges of a shape by one or two pixels at a time.</p>
  <p>Skeletonization is the stage in the analysis pipeline that takes the longest to complete,
especially when there are large shapes that don't conform to anything resembling a vessel.</p>

  <h3>Resize Inputs</h3>
  <p>Scale up or down the image.</p>
  
  <h3>Measurement Scale</h3>
  <p>Scale up or down pixel measurements.</p>
  
  <h3>Vessel Diameters</h3>
  <p>Enter a list of target vessel thicknesses. If more than one value is provided, the values should be separated by spaces or commas.</p>
  
  <h3>Vessel Intensity</h3>
  <p>Pixel brightness range.</p>
