  <h2>About</h2>
  <p>AngioTool was originally written by the Center for Cancer Research in 2011. It could only process one image at a time, which made it unsuitable for scientific research, despite the image processing features it possessed.</p>
  <p>This version of AngioTool started by simply adding batch processing as a separate feature, where the user could select multiple folders instead of just one image at a time. However, after processing the 15th or so image, it would run out of memory and cease to function.</p>
  <p>As such, the goal of the project was expanded, and gradually the entire program was rewritten piece by piece, including a new user interface, to allow for the batch processing feature to work as intended.</p>

  <h2>Features</h2>
  <h3>Batch Processing</h3>
  <p>Select folders of images to process, the output image folder, and a spreadsheet to write to.</p>
  <h3>Live Preview</h3>
  <p>Analyze a single image. Supports panning and zooming, and changing the settings to update the preview in real time.</p>

  <h2>Settings</h2>
  <p>AngioTool 2.0 provides various customizable settings to tailor image analysis:</p>

  <h3>Lacunarity</h3>
  <p>Measure how much space is empty.</p>
  
  <h3>Thickness</h3>
  <p>Measure the average vessel thickness.</p>

  <h3>Fill Holes</h3>
  <p>Fill in gaps between vessels below a certain size.</p>
  
  <h3>Remove Particles</h3>
  <p>Remove particles below a certain size.</p>
  
  <h3>Max Hole Level</h3>
  <p>The brightest a hole can be before it shall be filled in.</p>
  
  <h3>Min Boxness</h3>
  <p>The lowest "boxness" value that a hole can have before it shall be filled in.</p>
  <p>Boxness is defined as: min(holeWidth / holeHeight, holeHeight / holeWidth) * pixelCount / (holeWidth * holeHeight)</p>
  <p>The more a hole resembles square, the closer the boxness value will be to 100% and the further it will be from 0%.</p>
  
  <h3>Min Length &#xF7 Area</h3>
  <p>The lowest area divided by length that a hole can have before it shall be filled in.</p>
  
  <h3>Skeletonizer</h3>
  <p>Finds the center line of each vessel.</p>

  <h3>Max Skeleton Steps</h3>
  <p>Cap the number of times an image can be iterated upon by the skeletonizer.</p>
  <p>Each skeletonization iteration thins the edges of a shape by one or two pixels at a time.</p>
  <p>Skeletonization is the stage in the analysis pipeline that takes the longest to complete,
especially when there are large shapes that don't conform to either vessels, pathways or gaps between.</p>

  <h3>Resize Inputs</h3>
  <p>Scale up or down the image.</p>
  
  <h3>Measurement Scale</h3>
  <p>Scale up or down pixel measurements.</p>
  
  <h3>Vessel Diameters</h3>
  <p>Enter a list of target vessel thicknesses.</p>
  
  <h3>Vessel Intensity</h3>
  <p>Pixel brightness range.</p>
